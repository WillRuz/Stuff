# Final Project for Java 2

The goal of this project was to use a set of data points (hands,feet, knees, head, etc. locations) and plot them.
In this case, we are making a skeleton by connectin the dots of each data set's position.
This visual representation was made using data from babies' appendages while learning to crawl.
